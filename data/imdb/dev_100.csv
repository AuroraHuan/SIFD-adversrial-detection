The story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie . Then the story gets more and more outrageous . The Main character portrayed by Marina Sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role . This could have been a supergreat movie had the ending been more realistic .,1.0
"This documentary was my first introduction to Peak Oil theory . A fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct . I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon , it literally took my breath away . This movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the American way of life is dependent on the abundance of cheap oil a term used throughout the film . A lot of the topics are plain common sense , and they do n't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them . But you 've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does . The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting . I do n't think this film is meant to scare people . It 's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead , and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.After watching this film I was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same . Great documentary , everyone should see it .",1.0
"In the Belarus of 1942 , two Soviet soldiers are captured by Nazifriendly Belarusians . In captivity , the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly . One of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality , incomprehensible to the other man . Larisa Shepitko 's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history . The cinematography , by Vladimir Chuchnov , is incredible particularly in the opening sequence , where long , slow , tracking shots depicting the solitude and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural Belarus set the mood perfectly . It is easy to draw comparison to Tarkovsky 's films , even more so since Tarkovsky 's alter ego Anatoli Solonitsyn has a small but important part in The Ascent . The acting is overall brilliant , especially by Boris Plotnikov , in the part of Sotnikov . The film reveals an oldfashioned belief in the strength of religious passion , which feels related to characters such as Dostoyevsky 's Prince Myshkin , or Tarkovsky 's Stalker . However , this is not a weakness of the film , but rather one of its greatest strengths . The religious content seems so honest , and human , that it is impossible not to be moved . The emotional richness of the film can not be overstated the answer is not as simplified as a short summary of the plot would make you think . The slow development of the characters , and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other , are somewhat reminiscent of The Commissar , another great Soviet film . The Ascent deserves a second watching , as well as a third , and a tenth . It continues to provide interesting ideas , beautiful images , and emotional complexity .",1.0
"In Brooklyn , the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire 's , owned by her boyfriend Danny ( Gene Kelly ) . Rusty , Danny and Genius ( Phil Silvers ) have a ritual on Friday nights they order oysters in a bar , trying to find a pearl . The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine . She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway , whose owner proposes her . She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style , missing the love of Danny and her old friends . 'Cover Girl ' is a delightful romantic comedy , very naive and having magnificent parts , such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing , singing and acting Gene Kelly , specially in two scenes , dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars . Danny , the character of Gene Kelly , is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior . Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent I found her amazing in 'Gilda ' , but she is stunning in 'Cover Girl ' . In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS , 'Cover Girl ' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot , giving continuity to the story , instead of just being 'thrown ' in the movie . My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved 'Cover Girl ' , therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations . My vote is nine.Title ( Brazil ) 'Modelos ' ( 'Models ' )",1.0
"In a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema , in terms of capturing those strange , elusive moments of unguarded truth . In other ways , it is undeniably an amateurish , unfocused result of junkies selfindulgently fooling around with a camera . Ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability ( thankfully much more so the former than the latter ) . Part of me wants to reward it solely for it 's absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity , but at the same time I ca n't completely ignore the occasionally downright awful acting and overtly bad production values . At first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting ( or maybe just wrongheadedly innovative ) , but after a while I got used to it , which is , in the end , the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it 's own terms or not . I guess that answer basically sums up my allaround feelings for the film . That is , despite it 's inignorable flaws , on a whole it does work very well . And , if nothing else , a film like this really shows how false and contrived the fauxdocumentary , shakycam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect ( such as in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger ) . Here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation , and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look cool .",1.0

"First of all I 'd like to start by saying it 's a refreshing start to see a British Drama that finally looks and feels believable . Patrick Stewart does the role justice as ( Ian Hood ) , the government Science adviser , with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts about the future of real world science and how he feels It 's either being used or abused by others . Not only is the casting thoroughly maintained all the way throughout the Series , but it makes it 's characters seem more believable than most other British Drama 's . Ashley Jensen also delivers a first rate performance as Dr . Hood 's Appointed bodyguard ( Rachael Young ) , she brings a refreshing take on the unscientific , Uninterested everyday views of science , and her constant battling with Hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them.The way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic I Find positive and more engaging than the psychobabble we are so used to in other Fiction or Science Fiction TV shows . There are however notable disappointments with the series , every time an Episode ends I find myself disappointed that they did n't seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving openended stories unclosed . Although bearing in mind that this is still the first series , I hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve.For those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines , this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more Importantly to the point .",1.0
"My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in ... but I want to add a few words . National Velvet ' was one of my two favorite movies as a child . ( The other being 'The Wizard of Oz . ) The cinematography , the acting , the script , and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes . Based on a book by Enid Bagnold , the script followed the book quite well . The characters are so thoughtfully created . It 's easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little Irish village in which they live . The premise ... complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world ... is awe inspiring to any young person , especially a young girl in the 40 's ... a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes . You would have to be terribly hardboiled not to appreciate it 's merit . But the perspective I cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it 's moral message .. It 's almost magical how 'mom and apple pie ' the movies were back then . I was really taken aback by the IMDB reviewer who asked ... 'Was the world ever really this trusting ? ' and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding unchaperoned ' overnight travel involving the two main characters . My answer to his question is an unequivocal YES ! ! ! ! The movie going world was that trusting in the 40's.My grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released . Then my mother took me to see it when I was young , and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape . Now we have it on DVD . It 's been a family favorite for generations , albeit generations of horse lovers . It was never about sex ... it 's about coming of age ! It 's about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals . Also , so old fashioned it was n't even about the prize money ! It 's about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to be the best ' . And yes , the director was indeed concerned with Elizabeth Taylor 's lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about Velvet Brown ( Liz Taylor 's character ) having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase . This was a guys only sport back then ... I think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race . It 's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the Lolita thing about this particular movie ... besides , anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail.And now for a great bit of trivia ... the stunt riding was performed by the now famous Horse Whisperer ' , Monty Roberts . I believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits.I give this movie a 10 out of 10 ! I never get tired of watching it again .",1.0
"Of the Korean movies I 've seen , only three had really stuck with me . The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters . The second and third and now fourth too have all been Park Chan Wook 's movies , namely Oldboy , Sympathy for Lady Vengeance ) , and now Thirst . Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence towards convention . All his movies are shocking , but not in a gratuitous sense . It 's more like he shows us what we do n't expect to see typically situations that go radically against society 's morals , like incest or a libidinous , bloodsucking , yet devout priest . He 's also quite artisticallyinclined with regards to cinematography , and his movies are among the more gorgeous that I 've seen.Thirst is all that being about said priest and the repressed , conscienceless woman he falls for and more . It 's horror , drama , and even comedy , as Park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations . As such , this might be his best work for me yet , since his other two movies that I 've seen were lacking the humor element that would 've made them more palatable for repeat viewings .",1.0
"Does exactly what you expect , and then some . The first movie , was a step up from the TV show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased . Surprisingly , Jackass Number Two is even more twisted.The stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular , with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust.Knoxville , like always , dominates the proceedings , but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts , with Bam Magera also proving himself as wild as ever , despite having had his image toned down in 'Viva La Bam ' . Surprisingly , the infamous Wild Boys ( Steve O and Chris Pontius ) seem to take part in fewer of the skits , despite being focal in the previous outings.If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film , and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration , if you see it as childish , disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today , you will find it as offencive as ever . So f * * k off .",1.0
"1983 was the battle of the Bonds . That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond film , the former ( Octopussy ) was produced by the official makers of the Bond films while the later ( Never Say Never Again ) was produced unofficially by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball . Surprisingly enough is the unofficial film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball.Never Say Never Again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film . It all starts with Sean Connery , returning to the play Bond for the first time since 1971 's Diamonds Are Forever . Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever . The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love , just a few years older . Connery 's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was . The one downside to Connery 's age is his believability , especially when it comes to the ladies of the film . Let 's face it even Connery , despite being in top physical shape , looks as odd as Moore when he is bedding women half his age . Yet despite this believability issue , Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier Bond performances.Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles . Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable . Bassinger holds her own against her costars and has considerable chemistry with them as well . In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counterpart played by Claudine Auger.Then there 's the villain , Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer . Brandauer 's Largo is everything a James Bond film villain should be suave , charming , evil and above all believable none the less . Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other Bond villains have fallen into by going over the top . Brandauer plays Largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well . Barbara Carrera makes a fine henchwoman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears . Max Von Sydow a nice appearance as Blofeld , though his appearance is more akin to a cameo . Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance as Bond 's bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film . With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from Edward Fox 's M who makes for a great contrast to Bernard Lee , Pamela Salem who make s affine Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen 's wonderful Q . The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles . Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film.On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients . From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase , this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part . The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models , explosions , and all the things we expect from a Bond film . Irvin Kershner , then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back , brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.Yet this film is far from perfect . Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond films with its heavy use of 1980 's computer sand video games . While technology dates any film after a time , this film 's heavy reliance on it , especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release . The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it 's a remake of Thunderball.Yet for its predictability the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good . The script sports good dialogue scenes , not a single cringe worthy one liner ( how many of the Roger Moore era scripts can you say that about ? ) , some humorous situations , and yet is watchable and tense for the most part . Once you look past he fact that it 's a remake , there 's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film . Due to the unofficial status of the film , the James Bond Theme could not be used . That said this could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work . Unfortunately Michael Legrand 's score is far from adequate . Legrand 's score is totally out of place in a Bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works . To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a James Bond film.Despite being heavily dated , somewhat predicable , and having a bad score Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond film . With one of the best casts of any Bond film , good action sequences , good special effects , good direction , and some terrific dialogue , this film proves that unofficial is n't a bad thing . In fact it is is better then Octopussy and the winner of the battle of the Bonds .",1.0
"A gang of bandits lead by the shrewd , rugged , ruthless Monetero ( a perfectly imposing performance by Gilbert Roland ) steals $ 300,000 worth of gold coins during a daring train robbery . But untrustworthy member Bahunda ( an amusing turn by Jose Torres ) makes off with the coins and hides them . Unfortunately , Bahunda gets killed before he can tell Monetero where he stashed the booty . So Monetero has to join forces with cunning , cocky , enigmatic bounty hunter the Stranger ( smoothly played by the handsome George Hilton ) and cagey , corrupt banker Clayton ( a delightfully weaselly portrayal by 50 's teen idol Eddie Kookie Burns ) to find the coins . Skillfully directed by Enzo G. Castellari , with a clever , complex and twistladen script by Castellari , Tito Carpi , and Giovanni Simonelli , a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone ( everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon ) , a twangy , flavorsome , spirited score by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi , plenty of stirring shootouts and rousing rough ' n'tumble fisticuffs , a wickedly sly sense of selfmocking humor , a steady pace , and a real doozy of a surprise ending , this giddy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired sendup of Sergio Leone 's The Good , the Bad and the Ugly . Popping up in nifty secondary parts are the luscious Stefanie Careddu as Monetero 's fiery gal pal Marisol , Ivano Staccioli as a hardnosed army captain , and Gerard Herter as flinty lawman Lawrence Blackman . An immensely amusing and enjoyable romp .",1.0
"Flatliners has all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher film intelligent , youthful characters , stunning cinematography , a gripping story , and excellent performances . It 's escapist fun but it 's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving precedings.Schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors , and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things ( see the cast list ) . Their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average . Kiefer Sutherland shines in his egotistical medstudent role.The cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain , which is what I love about Schumacher his use of light and location create images that stick . A disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed reminded me of The Lost Boys.This is a film that takes an awesome premise curious students want to find out what 's after death , and successfully follows it through into a scary , gripping tale of redemption . One of Schumacher 's best highly recommended .",1.0
"The summary is only for those who hate this movie , as finding the movie OK or average is acceptable . Visiting this movie on IMDb has made me nostalgic as I ca n't help myself going back in the year 1994 . I was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters . It instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite . How can I say what made this movie my favourite ? Was it the excellent writing ( story was OK but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous ) Was it the superlative performances ? Was it the mood of the film ? After thinking about it for so many years I say it has to be a mixture . It is one of those movies which did n't have any flaws not even its music . ( the other movie coming up in my mind right now is Sholay ) PS Rajkumar Santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies . Only 1 comedy is not enough .

"Although it has been off the air for 6 years now , Promised Land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation . Good cast , supporting cast ( among them , Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis ) and crew . The plot is believable with McRaney packing up his family and just saying to hell with it all after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from Vietnam years earlier . I think a lot of Vietnamera veterans , myself included , could really relate to McRaney 's thought process in finally deciding on his course of action . Many of us did precisely the same thing in real life , after returning from that war and finding that America was not the same place we left . The show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life . In those two respects alone , I think it is one of the more poignant TV series of our time . Why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me .",1.0
"Mute Witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves . The film written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller is a tense , actionpacked thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences . No pointless mumbojumbo or endless plottwistsjust straight to the point mystery .

Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody . Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end . Regarding the similar topic , I 'd say it 's definitely better than the more famous 8 mm ' , directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage . The acting in Mute Witness is n't great , but the leading actress ( who 's Russian herself ) looks really cute . Sir Alec Guinness makes a special appearance , too . And a very cool one , I may say .

"I saw this movie in its brief run in art house cinema in '69 . I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor , having laughed so hard I fell out of my seat . In retrospect , years later , I thought it had been done by Melvin Van Peebles . When I mentioned it to a friend , he said that a friend of his , Downey Sr. , filled virtually every nonacting role in the flick Director , writer producer , etc .

"Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 45 minutes in length , it was not quite a feature film . With World War One just drawing to a close , many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops , and Chaplin was no exception . And so the lovable Tramp went to war ! The film begins with the Tramp in training , and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills , including marching and gunslinging , much to the disgust of his drill sergeant . The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches , faced with a more formidable foe , though the Germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he . The uproarious moment when the Tramp declares that he singlehandedly captured thirteen German soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitches.There are plenty of other great moments in this film . Chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious , as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface.However , the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree . The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers , unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy , as they are singlehandedly disabled onebyone are highly amusing , especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood.This is a very enjoyable film , and one of the best of Chaplin 's pre1920 efforts . Highly recommended .",1.0

"I just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it . The synopsis was listed in our program as an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party . I was n't sure if I was going to see it because when I read about it I liked the idea of a suicide party it sounded very interesting to me , but old Shakespearean actor had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring . But I decided to give it a try . I am glad that I did . It was not dry and boring in the least , that dialogue was great , funny in a clever way , but not pretentious and difficult to understand . Peter Falk was terrific in this role , he stole the show . I also was pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo 's performance , usually she bugs me , but I enjoyed watching her in this film very much . I think Judge Reinhold 's part could have been done better by another actor , at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting , not like you were just watching this character . But the movie was so good I was able to forgive one actor 's awkwardness . I would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public . Who knew suicide could be so hilarious ?",1.0
"This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing . It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era , but I recommend that all others beware . Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak . The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough , but there 's no real pacing or tension in the story . I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying , partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording . I give this a 55100 .

There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men . Amy Watson 's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment . Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man . If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so , left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce . The country and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumnal weather adds to the melancholy background superbly . The ending is perfect , so in tune with real adult life .",1.0

Her character was a little crazy , yet lovable clearly we all have known someone like Macy 's character . S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny . I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress . Law & Order never showcased the depth of Epatha 's acting abilities like Lackawanna Blues . I was pleasantly surprised and amazed !

"Inspired by True events , Radio is one of the best acted , heart felt dramas I seen widely released in sometime . It definitely is one of the year 's best films of 2003 . Radio stars Ed Harris , who is Oscar worthy nonetheless in this film , as football coach Harold Jones . Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game . However Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew . One day Radio , played by Cuba Gooding Jr. , in his best performance since Men of Honor , comes by the football field while the coach 's team is practicing for the game . Some members of the team , then tie up radio and throw him into a building . They then bang on the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong . He comes over and helps Radio , who is frightened , and from that point on Coach Jones and Radio shares a very special bond . Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events . He also becomes Coach Jones 's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and Radio.The movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life , accepting people for who they are even if they are different , death , and family relationships . The movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film . The thing I liked most about Radio was how real it felt . The performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes . Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama . Some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad . In conclusion , I feel that Radio was very overlooked by Critics only getting average reviews . They must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it does n't make any sense to me . Also the performances as I mentioned before are topnotch and Oscar worthy . In my opinion , both Ed Harris , who I think is underrated as an actor , and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie .

Park takes the method of vampirism seriously , and as well the torrid love story between Sanghyeon and TaeJoo . We see the conflicts of both of the characters Sanghyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that , unbeknownst to him , turns him into a sickly but trueblue vampire , and TaeJoo with her mother and idiot brother , the latter is killed by Sang as in a very strong melodrama . There 's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point , and the implications put forth from religion early on ( Sang , for example , is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism , even as he just ca n't be that and knows it ) on top of those about good vs evil , push it up into another plane cinematically.That Thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park has displayed with Oldboy , Lady Vengeance and the underrated I 'm a Cyborg but That 's OK , should be taken as a given . Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters , and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric , part romanticerotic , part dramatic and lastly fantastical . And it does n't always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie setup ( though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes ) . It 's more akin to the movie Near Dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was , and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention , and that the disease itself and its effect on a person 's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed . Once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds , you 've seen em ' all.Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor , much like Oldboy , only here with a bite ( pun intended ) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being . An example of this can be found with the Priest 's predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor . Or the manner in which TaeJoo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive , even as she 's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the bloodsuckers who 've brought pain and horror to her home . But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience . What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together , of drama and existential pains , of a Bunueliansurreal sense of Catholicism ( I especially loved the dynamic between Sanghyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for bloodsucking but really wants to be a vampire too ) , and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to TaeJoo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets . Not in a pornographic manner , but in the sense of these characters ' release and escape , which does n't last long over the scope of the story.If it 's not as great as Oldboy , it 's not something to carp about . Not all films Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece ( and , at the least , he 'll always be known as the man who directed that movie ) . But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre , and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general . The filmmaking is crisp and exciting and even dangerous ( and what a white room of 'daylight ' the characters live in ! ) , the humor is dark and hilarious , the acting is intense and moody especially from subtle strokes from Song Kangho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OKvin , and the ending , when it does finally get there , is one of those truly superb vampiremovie endings you 'll be talking about for years , in a good way . In a battle between Thirst and Twilight , Thirst takes the knockout in the first round . Between Let the Right One In or Near Dark , it 's tougher to call . 9.510",1.0
"Admissions is a fine drama even though they 're are some problems with the ending . Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college . To make her overworked mother not notice , she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote . All the acting is firstrate especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan . They both put in great performances . The climax is also very powerful . There are only two bad parts . First is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd . His part is underdeveloped . The other weakness is the ending . It goes around in circles , which I did n't expect with the 84 min run time . Besides that , the movie is definitely worth watching .",1.0
"probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared ( when all they make you do is walk out of the theater ) and movies that just should n't have been made . but this one is worth it . the only reason i did n't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it ( but her death scene makes up for it , believe me ) .... so here they are .. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie .. 1. my favorite death scene ever Paris Hilton 's ! after finding her boyfriend Blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck , Paige starts to run . well , speed walk is more respectable . she finds this like garage with all these cars in it . then ( one of ) the killers cuts her ankle from below ( this whole time shes holding a HUGE metal spike ) so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car . the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead .. I 've NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED OR LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE.2 . Paige 's boyfriend Blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him ( while hes on the ground ) and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat .. then he dies.3 . Elisha cuthbert ( carly ) ( one of the hottest chicks EVER ) does n't die PHEW but she does get her lips superglued together , punched in the face , and gets part of her index finger chopped off ( yeah , i felt like heaving ) 4 . Carly 's twin brother nick also survives , but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg.5 . nicks best friend Dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs , and then is decapitated . his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink .. then he gets covered in wax.6 . wade ( Carly 's boyfriend ) gets his Achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors , and then is attacked by the same scissors . he does n't die , but hes covered in wax , and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed , revealing his nasty bloody flesh . YUMMY ... so there it is . Definitely WORTH YOUR MONEY .",1.0
"James Hacker MP did n't expect that he would be the next prime minister . Unlike in America , the party is elected in Britain while we , Americans , vote for candidates regardless of their party . Despite the differences , Paul Eddington CBE 's performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior adviser , Sir Humphrey , played by another knight , Sir Nigel Hawthorne , and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returns to the scene as well . Now instead of pleasing some people , he has to please the nation rather than his constituency . Now , he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before . Now , he must approve the honors list and work with Her Majesty as well on a regular basis . Hacker is not the hacking type . He is rather than the every man who we like and do n't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator . Now , we see the prime minister 's point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes .",1.0
"This is a pretty clever , wellacted version of the modern 30s woman 's fairytale romance . In this case , she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social butterfly . Interestingly , her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemaking prowess , and the ladies of the office are depicted as the powers behind the throne . Lifted way above the average by Mrs. Astor 's intelligent performance .",1.0
"I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4 . Having seen some of the earlier comments here I think I would like to state firstly that I am not in favour of the death penalty . With that out of the way , I was expecting great things of this film , but it just did n't quite deliver . Dead Man Walking is very cleanly done , with good performances all round , and a good script . In fact it 's hard to fault it artistically . However , I felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment , it seemed to become sidetracked by the religiousmoral stance ( hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun ) . Although I 'm not a heartless individual , I did n't really empathise with any of the characters in the story . If you do n't take religion seriously then you probably wo n't see much in this film . I think that Peter Medak 's Let Him Have It was a much more powerful and moving film , and I would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that .",1.0
"This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I really remember liking it . However , I did n't have great taste back then ( not to say that I do now ) so I ca n't vouch for my nineyearold self too well . The movie was probably a 710 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point . Yeah , worth watching . I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is the one that appears when she is in the car crash . The song is Play a Love Song by the Jaguars and it is VERY hard to find and obtain . In fact , this movie is , too . I ca n't find it anywhere online or on DVD or on VHS . I 'd like to see it again so I can gauge if it was actually a good movie . Oh well .",1.0

"This was a very good 1950s western , one of the better ones I 've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on TV . It certainly had three big actors on the marquee Glenn Ford , Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson . It turns out that Ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles . Ford had the bulk of the dialog . He also was the good guy while Robinson was the bad guy and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson . She played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times . Ford handled his starring status very ably , as he usually did especially in westerns . He played a nice guy who did n't want to fight , was a peaceful man ...... but if you pushed him ..... look out ! The story had a nice mixture of action and lulls , not overdoing either . It had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the CineamaScope widescreen . It also featured realistic people in a realistic setting . That credibility with the characters , especially the supporting players , was most impressive . The men way outshined the women in this film , acting and characterwise . Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak the only negatives of the production . It 's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars.Even though it is over 50 years old , this western is one you 'd still find fastenough moving to enjoy , no matter how old you are or what you 're used to seeing . For classic film fans , this is almost a must with this cast and good story . Highly recommended .",1.0
"With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses , this was in my opinion David Jason 's finest series.Coming straight after his TV debut on 'Do Not Adjust Your Set ! ' , these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days . By comparison , Porridge , Open All Hours and that awful series 'Lucky Man ' did not come close.I believe Jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest . Shame on him . A new generation deserves to enjoy this . The series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against 'The Brothers ' which aired on BBC at the same time , before VCRs were commonplace.BTW , I have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant , Spencer , was played by Mark Eden Alan Bradley off Coronation Street . I am amazed he did n't try to murder Edgar Briggs ! ! ! !",1.0

"Arising from characters previously developed in a series of muchlauded shorts , THE CURSE OF THE WERERABBIT is about as far from runofthemill family fare as you can get beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts , this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family.The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit , who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate AntiPesto , a humane solution to all those pesky rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere . The business is a great successbut Wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good . When he tries to rehabilitate rabbits from their vegetablecrunching ways , he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions the WereRabbit ! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe ! The movie is full of crazy inventions , unexpectedly smart dialogue , and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLF MANmore than enough to entice even a jaded teenagerbut the real charm of the thing is in its characters . The amount of personality the artists and animators can wring from bits of clay is amazing they seem as fully alive as any fleshandblood actor . The DVD release ( and I recommend the widescreen ) includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well . Greatly recommended ! GFT , Amazon Reviewer",1.0

I 've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years , ( I loved the Brothers McMullen ) , and was impressed how good this movie is . My friend , who works at Magno Sound , told us that this movie was shot on Super 16 . The photography was so good , it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot . Furthermore , the music combined with Fred Carpenter 's direction , was art . The storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching ... very cool . The acting by the entire cast was good , especially the actor who played , Uncle Benny . He was amazing . This film was a nice holiday treat , and I was delighted to be one of the first to view a movie that many will be seeing in the future .",1.0

"The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom . Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how Hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen . The original film was shot inside a studio.For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake , Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him ( Paramount ) decided to see what The Man Who Knew Too Much would be like with a lavish budget . This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office . This was James Stewart 's third of four Hitchcock films and his only teaming with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film.I do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again . At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that Hitchcock favored . Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes . Doris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Knew Too Much . Her best scene is when her doctor husband James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco . Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene . But Doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once . Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple , Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie . Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about an assassination to take place in Albert Hall in London . Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock film . Doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother . The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9 . You could n't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956 , it even competed with the fast rising Elvis Presley that year . Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song beating out such titles as True Love from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days . It became Doris Day 's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.Instead of doing it with mirrors , Hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real Albert Hall and like another reviewer said it 's not directed , it 's choreographed . You 'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.This was remake well worth doing .",1.0
"Straight from the brilliant mind of animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz , Ftiche , or The Mascot as it is known nowadays , stands as a masterpiece of stopmotion animation that sadly , has been almost forgotten by now . Nevertheless , the work of this man deserves to be seen , and in fact , must be seen to be believed because the outstanding way the animation flows is simply unbelievable.Decades before Toy Story , Starewicz conceived the idea of moving toys , in Ftiche , he tells the story of a small stuffed dog that gets makes friends with the sick daughter of his maker . One day , his maker takes him away to sell him , and the adventure begins as he tries to find his way back home . In his Odyssey , he 'll travel from Paris to Hell , and will find the other toys that were supposed to be sold with him.It is a surreal experience to watch this movie , as Starewicz makes every imaginable creature come alive with grace and beauty . The other toys include a beautiful ballerina , who loves a thief , but she also is secretly loved by a clown , forming a love triangle an old woman , a stuffed cat and a stuffed ape complete the group . every toy is so detailed and very expressive that without words one can understand their motives.Truly , the surreal atmosphere the whole animation has it is remarkable . It is hard to believe that a work of this magnitude was done in 1934 since it looks even better than most of the current day animation . The influence it has in modern day animator such as Tim Burton and Henry Selick is very significant.This short is a masterpiece of animation and the outstanding work of one genius who done everything by himself and that has influenced animators for decades . Starewicz 's work is an immortal piece of art that should be seen by everyone . This work is not only for kids , adults as well will enjoy it and probably catch most of the subtext hidden in the movie.It is possible to find it in the Vampyr DVD as a bonus feature . Anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look .",1.0
"I 've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise . A Christmas Classic , it 's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s . The story line is simple Elisabeth Lane ( Barbara Stanwyck ) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine . At Christmas time , her boss , Alexander Yardley ( Sydney Greenstreet ) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about . The only problem is She has n't got any farm and she ca n't cook . To get out of the jam , Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend ( Reginald Gardiner , who has a farm ) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix . There 's a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman . Greenstreet , Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters . The only weak point is the leading man , Dennis Morgan . He starts well but as the movie goes on , becomes really a bore . One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part . Anyway , this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidays ... in Connecticut .",1.0

"I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who Buddy Holly was , nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television , tuned in to HBO , and watch this engaging biopic . What I remember was realizing that it was a ( somewhat ) true story , about someone who actually lived . I recall the music , great songs that I still love today ( I ca n't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well What a stud ! ) Then , came the end . He died . He freaking died . I could n't believe it . I had no warning , no prior knowledge like most coming into this film . It taught me a harsh lesson about life and how it does n't follow the rules that most movies teach us . I just watched the film again tonight and was engaged all over again ... and a little saddened.8 out of 10 , but I 'll admit to a little bias .",1.0
"When I first watched this movie I thought it was a very strange movie . But I know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie . So I decided to watch it one more time . The second time I watched it I realised that Albert Puyn is a very talented and a very original film maker . In the beginning the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern Europe . But they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950 's . They had plutonium which I think is a symbol for the futuristic trade . I think that it means that the movie 's real time is not specified . The music in the movie is creating a long music video which tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics , specially for the intro and the outro.Albert Puyn is using red and blue backcolor when he 's showing the symbols for communism ( red ) and the capitalism and western world ( blue ) . One can notice that IceT , has the name Mao ( communism ) and that when he 's in focus the backcolor is red . The american cop , starring Burt Reynolds , is always filmed with blue backcolor . The club where Mao and his gang hang out is also with red backcolor . Crazy six is pendling between the red and the blue color.The white little dog that Mao had in the beginning symbolize , I think , the controlling force . Mao had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the end . That symbolize , I guess , the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalistic way of thinking from the western world in Eastern Europe.I think Crazy Six is a very wellmade movie . Albert Puyn creates an scifiaction movie with a politicial depth . It 's a different but a very special movie about the communism fall in the Eastern Europe.I 'm looking forward to watch another spectacular movie of Albert Puyn .",1.0
"Welsh poet Dylan Thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in Whitehall.Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance . Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end , resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran , who had shot up his house , and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.The real story of this film is the love of two women , one ( Keira Knightley ) whose first love was Thomas ( Matthew Rhys ) , the second ( Sienna Miller ) who is Thomas 's wife . At times it reminds of The Singing Detective , as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity .",1.0

The Muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie . Kermit rides a bike , Fozzie drives a Studebaker , and another car , Gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons , ( which is one of my favorite moments by the way ) ) , and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest of the way by the Electric Mayhem 's bus ( Dr. Teeth , Floyd , Janice , Scooter , and Animal ) who meet up with them in the desert after Fozzie 's car breaks down.Even some Sesame Street Muppets make cameo appearances ( i.e . Big Bird is walking along on the road , on the way to NYC to break into public television ) . The end is also a very heartwarming moment . Every single Muppet created is in the final scene , along with a final Rainbow Connection reprise.But those poor Muppets worked so hard on their movie set , then it all comes crashing down , and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks .

"What a waste of great acting talent . This is a shame because with Catherine Deneuve , Mathieu Amalric , Emmanuelle Devos , Chiara Mastroianni , and Melvil Poupaud ( not to mention others less well known in America ) that 's a lot of acting talent to waste . This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment . After having enjoyed his Kings and Queens and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I actually left before the movie ended . The movie wandered around its central storyline ( involving Catherine Deneuve 's illness ) getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen . The movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much ( this was a story of family dysfunction ) so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical . Finally , the soundtrack ( which ranged from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson 's Midsummer Night 's Dream ) was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time . The photography ( the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen , where our only sight is through a small opening , making feel as if we are watching through a peephole , that then expands ) was also pretentious and inscrutable .",0.0

"As we are well aware , movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history , but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation .

This movie portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor , while making the third group ( Hindus ) look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations . The inaccuracies , coupled with the sear disregard for one 's faith as portrayed by 'Gian Singh ' was a disgrace to the highest format . Though on a more positive note , the actors did a great job in acting in their roles . Both Kristen K and Neve C played their rolls exceptionally .

"This story had the potential of a good film . The difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one .

Redford 's boyish good looks and All American charm just do n't cut it as an unlikeable , threatening , boor . Redford 's acting skillls are insufficient to make his character menacing .

"Although it can be VERY tedious at times , this movie is really not all that bad . The acting is fairly well done , if stereotypical , and the production values are pretty high considering some of the SciFi movies that were to come later in the decade.My biggest problem with this film are some of the very outdated characterizations in it . There 's the guy from Texas , the professional scientist , and worst of all the woman scientist who finally realizes her womanhood . For a film seeking to make a statement about mankind , it loses some of it 's impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes .",0.0

"Okay , if you discount the production value , the ugly outfits , and the big hair , this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90 's version . First Ann Firbank ( playing Anne Elliot ) , is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired . Amanda Root ( playing the same role in the 90 's version ) can express more in her big , brown eyes than Firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production . Anne is turned into a peevish , whining , boring character ( and what was with the scene during the long walk ' where she stops to spout off poetry ? ) . Henrietta and Louisa looked so much alike that the only time I could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other ( Henrietta was taller ) . And Louisa ! Never was there a more obnoxious character ! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth was supposed to be interested in her . She is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming , not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that 's like nails on a chalkboard . When she starts to chant , to Lyme , to Lyme , to Lyme , ' I started yelling , shut up , shut up , shut up ! ' The best part of the movie was when Louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because I knew I would n't have to see her anymore in the movie . Speaking of the fall at the cobb scene it was the mose poorly acted , badly directed and edited scene of the entire film . How does a person fall three feet down , land on her feet , and still be knocked unconscious ? On the plus size , the character of Elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90 's version . They also put in many more scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end.I 'll admit , I have bought this movie , even though I knew how sub par it was , but I 'm a huge Austen fan , so I 'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels . Watch this move if you 're morbidly curious , or to appreciate the 90 's version even more.The bottom line is , this version may follow the letter of the novel , but the 90 's version follows the spirit .",0.0
"A man ( Goffredo Unger ) is found floating in the sea among the wreckage of his destroyed boat , just off the Florida Coast . A helicopter winches him up only to reveal both of his legs are missing below the knees . Dr. Stella Dickens ( Valentine Monnier ) and her partner Dr. Bob Hogan ( Lawrence Morgant ) are marine biologists of some sort and are conducting research in the sea regarding Dolphins . While out at sea Hogan hears a strange highpitched noise . Intrigued he and Stella hire Peter ( Micheal Sopkiw ) and his assistant Sandra ( Iris Peynado ) to create a device to locate and track the source , or something like that anyway as it is n't made particularly clear . Meanwhile a scientist named Florinda ( Cinzia De Ponti as Cinthia Stewart ) who works at a rival organisation called the 'West Ocean International ' is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone within the organisation . More people are attacked and Sheriff Gordon ( Gianni Garko as John Garko ) is on the case . Peter , Stella , Hogan and Sandra all set out to sea . Soon enough they find evidence that something monstrous and very unfriendly may be lurking beneath the surface . Together with rival scientist Professor Donald West ( William Berger ) , Sheriff Gordon and the United States army they set out to destroy the monster , but there are other sinister forces at work as someone does n't want the genetically engineered creature to be exposed at any cost ! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr. this is a far cry from the classic Italian horror and splatter films of the 70 's and early 80 's . The script by Gianfranco Clerici , Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is drearily slow and will put most people to sleep well before the 90 odd minute run time has elapsed . The monster is barely used , large portions of this film are made up of footage of boats and helicopters . Large chunks of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious 'who 's behind it ' part of the story . There is n't really any gore to speak of , a guy with both his legs bitten off and someone with one arm is about it . The special effects on the monster itself are generally poor and it is shown in very quick flashes , disappointing . The cast of virtual nobody 's do n't help make this any easier to sit through . There really is n't much to recommend this film so I wo n't . Do n't bother , you can do a lot better .",0.0
"In the 1940s , Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom , thanks to her sultry beauty and , her highly exploited peekaboo hairstyle . She starred opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March , scoring screen successes in films like This Gun For Hire and I Married A Witch . She held her own with female stars as well , and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in So Proudly We Hail . But changing times and her own failings caught up with her , and by the end of the decade , her heyday was over . With two unsuccessful marriages behind her ( and two more in her future ) Veronica headed for New York City , where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight . It was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties . But by now , her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks . Without them , public interest in her soon faded again . She did return to the stage in assorted vehicles , but her success was minimal . Eventually , she relocated to Miami , Florida , where she lived in relative obscurity . In 1966 she went to Canada for a part in an obscure movie called Footsteps In The Snow which had no U.S. release . The following year , she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature . They approached her to star in their film Time Is Terror and convinced her to invest in the project . As one author put it , If ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown , this was it . Surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values , she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this Miami , Florida shot quickie . Looking utterly ordinary in long shots , and luridly aged in closeups , poor Veronica did n't act so much as walk through her part . As a deranged doctor , who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula , using flesheating maggots ! , she looks both bored and confused , her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to adlib while she struggles gamefully to don a pair of rubber gloves . The supporting cast is no help at all , merely advancing the plot by talking it to death . Director Brad Grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them , no need for anything resembling entertainment ( There is , admittedly , one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a Private DetectiveNurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that predates `` Weekend At Bernie 's '' by almost 20 years . ) According to Veronica herself , the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed . But in 1970 , the production company scraped it together , changed the title to Flesh Feast , and released it to cash in on Lake 's just published biography . And , because former leading ladies such as Bette Davis , Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies , this travesty was promoted as Veronica 's comeback film . This seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue , though , because it 's unlikely that the ( young ) audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who Veronica Lake was . As expected , it did nothing for Veronica 's career , and she died in poverty , three years later . A previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor 's laboratory ( overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue ) enlists the help of a multitalented chauffeur to cut up the body parts . Poor Mrs. Lustig , she sighs , I hope she does n't mind leaving her body to science . Try not to think about it , advises the chauffeur , sawing away . I guess you are right , Hans . concludes the detectivenurse , What is done is done . What a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star .",0.0
"* This comment may technically contain spoilers but it sure does n't contain surprises * My cousin and I rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie . Unfortunately , we did n't get too many laughs , and we certainly did n't get too many scares either.Plot outline A plane containing a company head 's daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives , so the company head assembles a team of personalities , rather than skilled hunters , to recover it.For the first 34 's of the movie , things get pretty boring . It mostly consists of shots of Big Foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him , and passing it off as nothing . We also see several shots of the party through Big Foot 's point of view , and he apparently sees in thermal vision.To set up the plot , we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions . maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming . Sure enough , we later see he can . There are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in . Maybe this is one of them that was overlooked . And obviously it is . Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members . And sure enough , thats the case . Along with those scenes , there are a couple of Oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you ! scenes , and sadly , they are among the scariest.Then , finally , people start dying . Well , 2 people at least . Plus , the bodies of past victims are discovered . The death scenes are pretty lame . It mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the Sasquatch grabbing them , then cutting to a different scene , but first , we are treated to some horrible screams off camera.Then at last , we get to see the protagonist 's final showdown with the monster . I got ta admit , I found it pretty exciting while it lasted . But alas , it 's pretty short lived , and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic . Then , some closing text with a rather boring conclusion.I ca n't say I recommend this movie . It 's not quite bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 , and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie . Just do n't bother with it .",0.0
"This film was n't good at all . I was able to catch it at a film festival and did n't appreciate the content I was forced to watch . It 's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family 's cornerstone ( Gabrielle Union ) dies . the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle 's Union 's brother . Well , actually , Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years , which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister . This had to be Billy Dee William 's worst performance in his career , ever . He looked as if he did n't remember his lines in a few scenes . He was an unlikable , hardly ever empathetic character , who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well . The two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman ( Lucy ) was trying to connect with him , his other daughter did n't want anything to do with him . Billy Dee 's character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from Paris for his sister 's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork . Why they had to fool him ? Because he did n't like attending funerals . I know . You 're asking , but he did n't want to attend his own sister 's funeral too ? Yes ! He claims he did n't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects . He did n't want anything to do with that . Now we 're suppose to empathize with that a * * hole ? The rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters . The director and editor did n't care to consider the pacing of the film . The flashbacks were painful to watch . It was a bad film . However , it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals a film that glorifies AfricanAmericans dependence on Caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with , even if it is a healthy relationship . When lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals , it makes me question the judgment of black people on film . In these same festivals , the only films that win awards are educational films about African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors . I 'm not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color . The problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views , which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses . These films are often onesided forms of didacticism . These films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around . The writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it . These films always slant the argument . What I am saying is , are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content , which to me means directing , acting , writing cinematography , editing , etc. , or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about African American culture ? Are we suppose to expect a film like Constellation to have a shot in the world against films like Million Dollar Baby and Sideways ? What happened to film being entertaining ? When I mean entertainment , I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark , staring at the screen , investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying , meaningful emotional experience . Why ca n't these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching ? Why ca n't these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest , telling the truth ? I believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity , to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being . We have only one responsibility to tell the truth.Robert McKee . Now that 's something I totally agree with . These same black film festivals put down Hustle and Flo as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks . However , it 's an honest film about a pimp with a dream . A pimp ca n't dream ? I recall the last time I saw a real pimp he was a human being . And are n't they , pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large , not just in the black community but all over ? The powers that be in black Hollywood believe that films like this are making AfroAmericans look bad in the eyes of others , as if others do n't know that there are pimps in the hood . The truth is , until African American people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world , then our films will never have a chance in the world . This film was awful . The best thing was the cinematography and Zoe .",0.0
"Some nameless aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot Kronos to rob the world of its energy . They 've got a prototype clanking around Mexico for openers and if he proves successful more will be sent . It would certainly take a lot of time for just this one Kronos to perform that task.For reasons I ca n't explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist John Emery who telepathically directs Kronos to his first targets . Since Emery is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without Emery as a controller , why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre.In any event scientists Jeff Morrow , Barbara Lawrence , and George O'Hanlon who work under Emery are n't fooled a bit about his nature . And of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giant.Kronos is a perfect film for the Fifties , the bad guys are never seen they 're just out there looking to undermine mankind . It 's a perfect film for the Cold War . And Jeff Morrow assures us we 'll be ready for them in the future.The players look like they 're having a grand old time mouthing as many clichd lines the writers could put in the script . I get the impression that Kronos is the kind of film Ed Wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care .",0.0
"* * * * * Spoiler or two , not that is matters * * * * * * Two things stand out about this movie . First is it 's been titled both Bruno and The Dress Code , and if you 've seen this movie you 'll catch the irony in that.Second is it 's addressing issues completely off the wall . The adventures of a grade school cross dresser is n't something that there was a crying need for a movie about , nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in . Shirley MacLaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying Bruno 's desire to wear a dress to religion , which probably opens up an even thornier can of wormswhat was she thinking ? Yes , there 's some humor and it 's not directly offensive , but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing . It does n't do much except repeat the liberal mantra that different people should be accepted ( or maybe excepted ? ) no matter what . Which is finebut in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along . Bruno does n't just want to wear a dress , he wants to show up looking like a miniature Gladys Knight on awards night , and his final costume makes him resemble a Cabbage Patch Cowgirl Doll . Yet all the other kids dress and behave , well , like regular kids . So what gives ? If it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like , and the result would be total chaos . This accepting of people who are different is also pretty narrowly defined , I doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls , hunt geese , and go to tractor pulls , and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is . Bruno is one stupid movie , and a complete waste of time .",0.0

"At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner ' .. at least where I come from . A bloke is trained by an excop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood .. and that 's about it . Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue . Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I 've seen in a film for a while , and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people . GREAT job on the dubbing too guys ( ! ) Best moment when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck , he just gets out his gun and BANG ! Why not do that earlier ?

"The only thing in Sudden Death that outdoes the amount of nonstop action is the incredible number of plot holes . What with that , and the sheer amount of contrivances , one could hardly call what 's left a storyline . To say the screenplay has borrowed from the Die Hard premise would be to make the world 's most blatant understatement ! Here we have a troubled hero working in the huge Pittsburgh Indoor Ice Rink as a fire Marshall . On the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game , and of course spend a little time with them . Also catching the match , but for political reasons , is the Vice President of the United States ( Raymond J. Barry ) . When a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the V.P . 's box and demand hundreds of millions in government money , our hero Darren McCord has his plans more than slightly put out.Each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys , and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them . Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top ( not that this is an original sin ) in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists . The horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service , the security and the civilians ( both old and young ) with gay abandon , and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim.Van Damme engages in plenty of fistycuffs and gunplay , heroics and death defying stunts . The script asks little of the musclebound European . Almost everyone else has walkons apart from Powers Boothe , who seriously overdoes his under written , shallow role as the cruelest , meanest old ring leader there ever was.There 's a lot of clever cinematography , and enough explosive special fx to keep anyone awake . But really , that 's all this action flick has , action . Though there are some nifty sequences , nothing could be called outrageously brilliant.Saturday , February 10 , 1996 Greater Union Melbourne",0.0
"Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle . People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend , but as is the case with many of the genre 's clichs the Italians did it first . Movies like Eyeball , Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery . There were also a couple of American preHalloween slashers that warrant a mention . Classroom Massacre , Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly predate 1978 , whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teenkill movies . Carpenter 's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare , but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen . Over the years we 've seen some memorable contenders , but my favourites would have to be My Bloody Valentine 's maniacal miner , The Prowler 's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games ' copperfaced assassin . I 'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category . The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen 's costumes.A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie , probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion , which of course does n't exactly make for a scary disguise . But in later years both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit . Here 's how the later of the two fared The screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens , as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation . It seems that a stressedout gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy lowbrow turkeys , so he 's decided to hold his wife and kid at gunpoint . Detective Shine ( David Clover ) manages to wrestle with the gunman , but unluckily for him he looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it 's the end of the road for the grey haired officer . Fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from Lisa Ryder ( Donna Adams ) , the California Police Department 's hottest female lawenforcer.Her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to Detective first class , and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts . Meanwhile a leatherclad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners . Ryder and Shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called Michael Walker ( John Mandell ) . Lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal Police regulation does n't seem to apply to her , so before long she 's dating the cameraman even though he 's suspect numero uno . When the bodies continue to pile up around the city , she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S & M madman If anything , Zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its rein . What started as a great steppingstone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction , zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors . The boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their lack of strong dramatic lineups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes . Unfortunately , by this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week , Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature 's characters ended up . In an early grave.Donna Adams does n't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be . Mansour Pourmand could n't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial . I searched and searched , but found nothing here of merit or note.On the plus side , if you manage to keep the TV turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killer 's identity . To be honest though , I doubt that by that time you 'll even care . And another plus point ? Well , erm .... the disc is perfectly symmetrical , which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon ? ? Aside from that there 's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface . Bad bad bad and not in a good way , this is 90 minutes of my life that I could have spent more constructively by plucking my chesthair . Abysmal .",0.0
"Why did I buy this movie on DVD ? , Well the short answer would be I really do n't know . As for the longer version , it pretty much comes down to the fact that I genuinely like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in this.Now does Tatyana Ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie ? I must say that it is one of the better , and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress . I am very much looking forward to see her in action , when better material will be available.This being said , this movie was terrible and my score is given based on this 1 star for not being the worst movie I 've seen , 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali , and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars , there are worse movies for that.Ja Rule should stick to rapping , not my favourite rapper to say the least , but some seem to like him and if he is contained there , I would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.Ving Rhames Ah man , Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here you used to be cool man . Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor , who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good , you do n't have to copy him Ving.The rest of the semi big names in the cast It 's OK , there are bills to be paid , and we all have to do things we 're not proud of time to time.The movie itself . It so massively flawed , it 's pretty difficult to know where to start . It 's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together , as were the director to say we need to tell this , and we need to tell that .

To say the least , the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.To sum up in one word Reallynotgood",0.0

It may have been considered racy in its time , and may have made money , but even the most diehard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck.There are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time , even though dated by current standards , but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot . The French Line , however , fails at all of these aspects.It does n't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material .

"The film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from Something Weird Video in their Driver 's Ed Scare Films Vol . 5 . For one thing the 1980 version is in color . SWV has on this disc an earlier version ( 1972 ) of the film made in b & w for WLWT television Channel 5 in Cincinnati . Either way this film is notorious . However , unlike most other driver 's ed films , this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public . Thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down . It 's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent . I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on Channel 5 . If you 're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely American film phenomenon , The Last Prom is pretty typical morose , hyperbolic , extremely didactic , heavy on melodrama .

"Wow , this film was terrible . It is as simple as that . It is actually the first time that I walked out early , as far as I can remember . This turned out okay , though I had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a movie.Where to start . Bad acting , bad jokes . Faecal humour , which I simply can not stand . Sorry , but snot , pee and scat are * not * funny . You have seen the title picture ? That scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes , with the two heroes hitting and mutilating each other , which is supposed to be humorous all by itself .

"The first half of this movie was quite good . It was interesting and suspenseful . The second half was pretty bad . The comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted good guys blowing them away . There 's a lot of violence in this movie . I 'm not squeamish about violence but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie . There was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles . We 're somehow supposed to be amused by this.I watched Reservoir Dogs recently . There was a movie where violence was employed effectively . It was realistic within the world the movie created . There were never any overthetop sound effect . It was a crime movie which played it straight . Inglorious Basterds should have played it straight but did n't . I was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.None of the backstory of any of the Basterds is really explained either , they 're simply Nazi hunters . We do n't really get to like any of them either because they 're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face . It 's all about revenge and very little else.There was 2 12 hours to work with here but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth . This seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple . We saw that in Tarantino 's last flick , Death Proof which I did n't care for either . It suffered the same problems . The characters were almost interchangeable.The first half again , was pretty good . I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe .

The Dungeon of Horror might be the worst movie I 've ever seen ( some of anyway . I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it ! ) . Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age , there may be worse movies I 've seen , but thankfully , I ca n't remember them . The sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint . The special effects looked like a fifth grader 's C diorama set in a shoebox . The movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant . He then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim , who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it , without the gun having been reloaded ! This movie was so bad my DVD copy only had name credits . I guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated . Though I guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio is n't needed . This movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as The Manipulator , the worst movie I have ever seen with an actual ( one time ) Hollywood leading manMickey Rooney . The only time I would recommend watching The Dungeon of Harrow ( or The Manipulator for that matter ) would be if someone were to pay you . ( I 'm kind of cheap ) I 'd have to have $ 7 or $ 8 bucks for Dungeon and at least ten for Manipulator . philthe never out of the can cinematographer",0.0
"Well to start off I was like , wow this is new , so when is the film starting , and out of this in between stuff . But it never ended . The film is just one big in between ! And after 10 minutes of waiting for something to actually happen , apart from water splashing around , I just started getting angry ! There is nothing in this documentry and nothing will be learned . Completely BORING and RUBBISH !",0.0
"TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection . They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this angers me because Van Damme is a personally favourite for B movie comedy . Segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself . It also annoys me how he did n't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films . In conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper , then rent today you die .",0.0
"Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous , disfigured gypsy . The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film , that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination . The victim characters are alltoofamiliar idiot teens which means one does n't really care about them , we just wonder when they will die ! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless , unnecessary nature footage . However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans , the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere , and a decent music score by Don Peake . Still , it 's business as usual for deadcamper movies.There are much better films in this vein , but over all The Prey may be watchable enough for diehard slasher fans . Although one might be more rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn ( 1981 ) , Wrong Turn ( 2003 ) , or even The Final Terror ( 1983 ) again . * 12 out of * * * *",0.0
"While I 'm normally a big fan of John Turturro 's work as an actor and director , ILLUMINATA is a great disappointment . Although the film has some charming moments , overall it falls flat . Worst of all , the film is confusing . Where is the movie set ? Italy or an Italian troupe in New York ? Why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting ? If you want to see a wellmade , inspiring historical film also about theater , go see Tim Robbins ' THE CRADLE WILL ROCK . This movie has many pluses , including a fine performance by John Turturro .",0.0
"A comingofage story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small Norwegian village . The countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding , with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures . It 's like watching a religious propaganda movie . Theisen , who has made only one other movie , is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist , as are Sundquist as her strict father and Riise as a woman that Theisen is fascinated with . The film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired . Director and cowriter Nesheim , who has worked mostly in TV , is not up to the task .",0.0
"I watched this film when I was a kid , and I thought it was terrible then . Now that I 'm older , I found it just as terrible . Universal could have done better than this . They merely decided to make the most money they could out of using all their monsters at once . To me , that was a cheap shot . These characters were capable of holding their own in their own movies , and the choice of actors was deplorable . Dracula needed to be Bela Lugosi , Frankenstein 's , monster needed to be Karloff.In my mind , it was the Disney squalid sequel sequence done decades ago , and it was not appreciated . Umiversal started out with something great and original , and then thought they could pander to the masses with the schlock which is extremely evident in this film .",0.0
"I have n't read the book of this and based on this adaptation , will not bother . I hated every character in this show Miranda was slutty , selfish and mumbled miserably through the appalling dialogue , her sister was a total wimp , and this was the worst depiction of manicdepression I have ever seen . I have a degree in Psychology , and this was not accurate . In fact , until it was mentioned , I did not realise Troy was supposed to be bipolar I thought he was a normal , slightly grumpy teenager.The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant , whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half . Clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research Troy 's mental problems are not remotely accurate , nor are the forensics involved in the twist ending ( and if you did not spot that a mile off , you are a big ole dummy ! ) Utter garbage .",0.0
"It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing sex . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I 'm interested in is highly offensive . Take The Convenant , a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot andor a script that was n't written by a six year old . This is essentially The Craft with ( supposedly ) hot guys . And , yeah , that 's it . It bored me to tears . Even my friend , who usually laps us crap films , hated it . It is really stunningly bad , to the extent where it can actually be funny . I would have laughed if it was n't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it . They were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the ( really clich ) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end . Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film . I do n't think mainstream , Hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers ( or , indeed , for anyone ) so I think I 'll give up . Unless you 're a teen who likes The Pussycat Dolls , thinks Paris Hilton is hot and watches MTV it 's like some sort of wasteland . Life 's hard when you 're a fifteen year old who likes art house .

"Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor , but this is in a league of its own . In fact this might even be the worst ( Sandra Bullock ) movie ever made . I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original , SPOORLOOS . The altered ending here is stupid enough ( and executed with particular ineptitude ) , but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic . The real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity . Will the real George Sluizer please stand up ?",0.0
"The good things first I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene . He does I was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh . And there were other moments I found amusing Raymond 's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing , and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger . But overall , I was dismayed . I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock . And I understand the restrictions laid on productions by the Hays Code . But this was embarrassing and awful to watch . Of course I knew they 'd end up together , this is a romantic comedy after all . But it made no sense , it happened too fast . Plus I ca n't believe the professions of love when confronted with such hurtful behavior , both physical and confrontational .",0.0
"Will Spanner ( David Byrnes , the fifth actor to play the role in the series ) stumbles onto another bizarre case , this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches , warlocks & demons ( he 's at the hospital to check on his friend 's son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl who 's been attacked by a vamp in ) . He brings in Detectve Lutz to help out with the case which revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business merger to go through to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense.The plot of this movie pretty much takes a backseat to the nudity & simulated sex scenes . ( As is to be expected from this series , i guess ) . So complaining about the lack of good acting , or compelling plotline , or even convincing characters , I suspect , would fall on deaf ears . If you 're watching this film , you do n't care about such 'frivolities ' and just want some 'action ' . Sadly on that front the film fails as well . All the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious . Making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way.Eye Candy Both Kimberly Blair & April Breneman show everything Ashlie Rhey shows full frontal Aline Kassman & MaiLis Holmes only shows their breastsMy Grade D",0.0
"This appears to be one of Noel Coward 's lesser known films , and it is easy to understand why . Taken at face value it 's not a bad film , but there 's nothing terribly good about it either . Nothing much happens at all throughout the course of the film , it 's simply the story of Chris and Leonora 's illfated affair , and Barbara 's reaction to it . The only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know it 's going to end badly for one reason or another , owing to the first scene . Oddly , there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict , and yet none of them are utilised . For example , it would 've been much more interesting and believable if Barbara had 've fallen out with Leonora , but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film . The notion of Barbara having been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all in fact she did n't even seem to feel betrayed by her husband she even encourages him to go on a holiday with Leonora . Similarly , Chris ' two secretaries at his practice , Susan Birch and Tim Verney , who also happen to be close friends of both Chris and Barbara , are never forced to take sides . In fact , Tim shies away from conflict by telling Chris that he 's terribly fond of both him and Barbara . Despite the strange lack of conflict , the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we do n't care whether Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara . The two womens ' personalities are indistinguishable anyway so we do n't know which of the two is better suited to be with Chris , and besides this , Barbara 's permissiveness gives the impression that she hardly cares about the affair anyway . Furthermore , I found Chris and Leonora 's relationship somewhat unconvincing . I can overlook the ridiculously short timeframe in which they fall for each other because that is so common in films of this era , but even then the relationship seemed shallow . Coward 's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of Leonora 's affections . He reminds me of the socially inept genius Sir Earnest Pease from the film Very Important Person I 'm sure the two would 've gotten along well . Chris ' coldness and austerity made his love for Leonora seem insincere . I think Coward should 've sat this one out and given his part to a younger man as it is , I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a sombre , mostly emotionless , balding middle aged man . Despite all my criticisms , the film still manages to be interesting just not terribly compelling . The fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature , which is somewhat intriguing . The Astonished Heart is certainly worth watching , but it is a flawed piece of cinema .",0.0

"I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS ! ! ! ! This 16mm disaster is full of clichs , stereotypical characters , a generic , over done plot and terrible dialog.In this Movie we have the Aggressive Black Guy , The Black Guys Girlfriend , The Blonde Bitch , The Possible Lesbian hacker chick , the Pedophilic teacher ... Blah , Blah , Blah .... And then the Pumpkin Man.Do you think someone is taking the legend too far ? This question is asked towards the end of the film .

This is the most sissified way to end a movie . I do n't know how to explain all of this , and we do n't have any more money ... Let 's make the whole thing a dream . This is what the directorproduceractorFX guy must have been thinking . Yes , the director is the character of Mr. E He did almost everything on this garbage movie . This is such a cope out ending .... And what of the principal , okay , so he has been doing all the kidnapping ! What did that have to do with the movie ? Of course the Black people are killed , the bitchy girl is killed , the teacher that has a past of sexual harassment with students gets killed ( he is main suspect ) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK ! ! ! This movie gave me heart burn.Pointless , senseless , and made with parents Visa and Mastercards ( which tells me it is probably still being paid off ) , this movie is dumb , boring and just plain stupid ....

"This film made me so angry because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account on IMDb to share with you my opinion . I liked Ashton Kutcher in A lot like love and this is why I still wanted to see this film despite it 's current 4.2 rating . It is highly overrated . I trusted that an actor ( any of them ) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such lownow quality production . It is very disappointing . The theme of homesitting was much better used in Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo . Things that did not make sense here fist of all , the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who does n't know anything about taking care of it . Secondly , the rule is not to let anybody in the house , but the housesitter fails to follow this simple rule . The door is not locked ? ! And so on ..",0.0
"Not really all that much to this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie , goes to bar , is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady , offer him a job , he goes back to their place , refuses , the police ask him to accept their ya go ! ! ! What plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them . I am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end , but hey it is a bad movie , you always get scenes that make little sense . I am still trying to figure out if I misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver . They may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and I would n't think it would be all that uncommon for a stunt car to crash . The actors are bad , and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent ... really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the pits .",0.0
"I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60sfilms so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh . So , because of this it 's natural that I 'd choose this filmespecially because with John Agar in it , it was practically guaranteed to be bad . Sadly , while it was a bad film , it was the worst type of bad filmdull beyond belief and unfunny . At least with stupid and overthetop bad films , you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting . Here , you never really see that much of the monster ( mostly due to the darkness of the print ) and the acting , while bad , is more low energy bad ... listless and dull.The film begins with some young adults going to Satan 's Hollow to neck . Well , considering the name of the place , it 's not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces ! Duh ... do n't go necking at Satan 's Hollow ! ! Well , there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky , so what do the teens go ? Yep , throw a dance partya very , very , very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion . So it 's up to the Sheriff ( Agar ) and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication.As for the monster , it 's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly maska bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER . Not exactly original and not exactly high tech . To make it worse , it makes snorting noises and moves very , very slowlyso slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it ! How it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me.Overall , too dull to likeeven if you are a fan of lousy cinema .",0.0
"After seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker , I found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did . The creators of the movie had no intention to call the film 8MM 2 . Originally , the film was called The Velvet Side of Hell but was changed at the last minute by Sony Pictures to 8MM 2 without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter . By doing that , it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertising.Again , this is from the filmmaker 's mouths , not mine , so I really ca n't say what is truth , and what is hype.If you look at the film as Velvet Side of Hell , it is n't THAT bad . It is n't great , but it is not god awful . It would basically just be a Bmovie that likes to show boobs . But as a sequel to 8MM , the film fails terribly .",0.0
"You know that this film is in SERIOUS trouble when the BEST acting job is the support role played by Arnold Schwarzenegger . While this was still relatively early in his career and he was n't the best actor , compared to Brigitte Nielsen , he 's Sir John Gielgud . In fact , this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly selfdestructive football player , Mark Gastineau . So , instead of this being her break out film , this and a Beverly Hills Cop movie mark about as high as she went in her onenote career . It was obvious , too , that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well , because the supporting cast ( aside from Arnold ) is pretty lame and the script is dull , dull , dull . Fans looking for another CONAN movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film .",0.0
"An elite American military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who ca n't quite grasp teamwork , lots of bats , some terrorists , and a Spetznaz team that acts like the gang that ca n't shoot straight all thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre acting . This one has nothing much going for it . The characters are not compelling . Even the setting , which has great possibilities , looks like something out of the middle of rural Pennsylvania , not an exotic Boreal forest in Eastern Europe.The bats are certainly ferocious looking . They can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet ( harpies ? ) or chop off an arm . You see Delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault rifles and pistols at them and bat flopping to the ground . It would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet . Utterly clueless . The dialogue is rancidly unrealistic , with boygirl jokes and flirts in the middle of tense parts of the mission . One of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body , stunned , not even bothering to take cover or secure the area . In fact AFTER the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield thanks for the heads up bub.If you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out Outpost . Harvest is not the movie you want to see . In fact I think I 'm going to give it a two instead of a three if I can make it through the second half . Seems unlikely at this point .",0.0
"I go to blockbuster , pick out a random movie , got this , and yeah.This ... was a good sexual porno .. the quality kind of sucked , and it kind of gave me a damn headache . To me , this movie was good for its sexual things , but not as much for the horror and suspense . It was ... magical ... The suspense .. not as good as I would have expected . I wanted to be at the edge of my seat hoping to jump up in fear , but instead I lay down on the couch and did n't see much.The quality .. not really good at all . I mean , if you pay close attention , during when the people are on the COLD mountains , their barely wearing anything . It does n't make much sense too.So if your looking for a crap , not really suspenseful , and a pretty much sexual movie , you 've got this .",0.0

I ca n't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung . I can hear it now , You getting ' paid ? Nope , you ? I understand that this flick was more than likely made on a shoe string budget but even with that taken into account , it still could 've been better .

"Based on a joke once told by Jim Wynorski ... that 's what I 've read at the end of the closing credits . Well , Mr. Wynorski got ta have an awful sense of humour then ! This film is terrible , really . I loved the first two chapters of The Slumber Party Massacre series the third film was quite useless , but completely watchable , compared to this piece of crap ! There 's not even a Driller Killer and the plot , the acting , the characters , the locations , the events ... everything is boring , absurd and laughable . The only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls if this film were a porn , I think it would have worked really much better ! The film lacks gore too the first scene ( the one in the tent ) could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking at the door lasted one second ! Some moments of slight thrilling ca n't save a nonexistent plot . Buzzy ( Lunk Johnson ) seems to be the only real actor here I found him the only bearable character in this movie ! Oh ... there 's a nonsense part with Brinke Stevens , who performed Linda in the first Slumber Party Massacre the police bother her to know more details about the killer but what we get is only some footage from the first film ! Not a dialogue , neither a monologue , or anything from this stilltraumatized grownup girl , who 's forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life ( as she says ) , giving us no clues at all about the murderer !
